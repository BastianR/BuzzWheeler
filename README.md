# Buzz Wheeler

Wheel chooser to randomly select one item or person who has entered his name in the app.

This application is made for my 35th birthday. The user has to type all persons/player in the list. After that, the user clicks "roll" and the wheel is spinning. In my case, I have built a button box with a big buzzer. The buzzer is the "roll"-key.
After a "roll" is triggered, the application chooses one random player to do something. Maybe to drink a shot or something else :) ...!

Here a screenshot of the application:

And this is my selfmade button box:
